### Error storage:
* **ValueError: non-broadcastable output operand with shape (3,1) doesn't match the broadcast shape (3,4)**
>[LINK](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47493559/valueerror-non-broadcastable-output-operand-with-shape-3-1-doesnt-match-the/47493938)  Thanks!

解决办法：Change self.synaptic_weights += adjustment to

>self.synaptic_weights = self.synaptic_weights + adjustment

**self.synaptic_weights** must have a shape of (3,1) and adjustment must have a shape of (3,4). While the shapes are broadcastable numpy must not like trying to assign the result with shape (3,4) to an array of shape (3,1)

* **ValueError: matmul: Input operand 1 has a mismatch in its core dimension 0, with gufunc signature (n?,k),(k,m?)->(n?,m?) (size 1 is different from 3)**

解决办法：You are transposing a Matrix with 3 rows and 1 column to a Matrix with 3 columns and 1 row. Then you are multplying it with a similar Matrix (also 3 columns 1 row) which is incorrect mathematically. So you can either remove the transpose function or define your R Matrix as 1 row 3 columns and then transpose it. Check this for further information.

* **StringIO in Python3**

解决办法：
>when i write import StringIO it says there is no such module.

From What’s New In Python 3.0(https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html):

>The StringIO and cStringIO modules are gone. Instead, import the io module and use #io.StringIO# or io.BytesIO for text and data respectively.

* **Python3 error: initial_value must be str or None, with StringIO**
>[LINK](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31064981/python3-error-initial-value-must-be-str-or-none-with-stringio)  Thanks!

* **AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'urlretrieve'**

### python3 Idea:
+ **pythonlist嵌套**
